# EECS 738 Project 2: Hidden Markov Models

This is Surabhi Khachar and Andre Kurait's second project for EECS 738, Machine Learning in Spring 2019. For the project one, we built a Hidden Markov Model using Python and tested it on datasets from Kaggle.

The project requirements were the following:

1. Set up a new git repository in your GitHub account
2. Pick a text corpus dataset such as 
https://www.kaggle.com/kingburrito666/shakespeare-plays 
or from https://github.com/niderhoff/nlp-datasets 
3. Choose a programming language (Python, C/C++, Java)
4. Formulate ideas on how machine learning can be used to learn word correlations and distributions within the dataset
5. Build a Hidden Markov Model to be able to programmatically
    1. Generate new text from the text corpus
    2. Perform text prediction given a sequence of words
6. Document your process and results
7. Commit your source code, documentation and other supporting files to the git repository in GitHub

<h1>Data</h1>
The data chosen for this project was from "The Examiner - SpamClickBait News Dataset" (https://www.kaggle.com/therohk/examine-the-examiner#examiner-date-tokens.csv) found from https://github.com/niderhoff/nlp-datasets 

Data features headlines from 3 million articles
